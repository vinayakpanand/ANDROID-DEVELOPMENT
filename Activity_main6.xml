 android:text="Sabarimala Sree Dharma Sastha Temple, dedicated to
Lord Ayyappa, is the most famous and prominent among all the Sastha temples
in Kerala. The temple is situated on a hilltop (about 3000 feet above sea
level) named Sabarimala in Pathanamthitta district, which is unique. The
temple is open to people belonging to all religions. There is a place near
the temple; east of Sannidhanam (the abode of Lord Ayyappa), dedicated to
Vavar (a close friend of Lord Ayyappa) which is called Vavaru Nada, an
epitome of religious harmony. Another unique aspect of this temple is that
it is not open throughout the year. It is open for worship only during the
days of Mandalapooja, Makaravilakku, Vishu and also during the first day of
every Malayalam month. It is said that the pilgrims have to observe
celibacy for 41 days before going to Sabarimala. Pilgrims take the
traditional forest routes as well as the one from Pamba which is less
physically challenging to reach the temple."
